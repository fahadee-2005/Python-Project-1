# BMI Calculator ðŸ§®

This is a simple Python project I made to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index) using user input.

### ðŸ”§ What it does:
- Takes your **weight in kg**
- Takes your **height in inches**
- Converts height to meters
- Calculates your BMI
- Tells you if you're underweight, normal, overweight or obese

### ðŸ“š Concepts I used:
- Variables
- Data types (float, string)
- Taking input from user
- Type conversion
- Basic math
- If/elif/else statements
- Printing outputs
- Round function
- Commenting code with `#`

### ðŸš€ How to run:
Just run the Python file and enter the values when it asks.
